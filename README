# Spring Utils

This repository contains:
* a PyTorch data loader for Spring, see `dataloader.py`
* code to convert Spring data into point clouds, see `pointcloud.py`
* code to convert Spring disparity maps into metric depth maps, see `get_depth` in `pointcloud.py`

## Setup
Required python libraries:
* [flow_library](https://github.com/cv-stuttgart/flow_library) (for reading/writing flow/disparity files)
* open3d (for 3d point cloud visualization)
* pytorch (for dataloader)
